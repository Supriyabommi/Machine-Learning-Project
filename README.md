### Machine-Learning-Project
#### Breast Cancer Detection and Classification
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is derived from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
They describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

1) ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3â€“32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry 
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
In this machine learning project, we implemented the pocket perceptron learning algorithm to classify the tumor cells as 'Benign' or 'Malignant'.
Also enhanced the model's accuracy by implementing the pseudo-inverse method.
